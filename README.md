# Virtual Dice Rolling Experience
Design and build a virtual dice rolling experience.

###Requirements
- Implement your experience with any iOS or macOS compatible 3D framework or engine (Unity, Unreal, WebGL, SceneKit, RealityKit, ARKit etc).
- Feel free to interpret this assignment to best demonstrate your design and technical skillset.
- This assignment should take no more than 8 hours to complete. 
- The final submission should include the following items: video capture of your creation, source code, a functional build, and any instructions or written documentation that is necessary. 

### Things to consider
- You may interpret the core task of “dice rolling” beyond a six sided cube and a flat surface.
- This is your opportunity to showcase your strengths! Areas of interest we are interested in evaluating include: 3D asset creation, realtime VFX, shader programming, experience design, sound design, spatial computing sensibilities, and code quality. Help us understand who you are, and what you love to create.
